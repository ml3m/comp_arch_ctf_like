"I choose to have faith, because without that, I have nothing....It's the only thing that's keeping me going."

The given file (jail) is a 64-bit ELF executable designed to run exclusively on a Linux system with an Intel x64 architecture. Your objective is to scrutinize the program (executable), comprehend its behavior and limitations, and devise a method to access the ./flag.txt file.

Here you can find a basic script to help you debug/solve the challenge: https://github.com/Fineas/-mama-/blob/master/helper1.py

Here you can find the demo that was presented at the lab: https://github.com/Fineas/-mama-/blob/master/helper2.asm

The challenge was created on an Ubuntu 22.04 machine (this shouldn't impact you, but if you come across any issues when running the executable, keep in mind that it might be due to a mismatch in system libraries).
