Howdy Cap! I heard you failed on your last time travel adventure through the EDSAC realm. Luckily, there is another opportunity just 36 years ago. Hold on tight and make sure you secure the flag stone this time. Good luck!

Note that the provided file (challenge.py) differs from the actual challenge file, running on the server, by only a few characters. Namely, the flag that is inserted in the source program is not the real flag. It is just a dummy flag with the same length as the real flag. Your goal should be to write a program for the VM that is able to exfiltrate the flag. Once you get it working locally, run the solution on the remote server to get the real flag. "Can you do this all day?"

Obey the rules!

Note that the provided file (virtual_machine.py) is the actual challenge file that runs on the server. Your goal should be to write a program for the VM that is able to satisfy the conditions from the bottom of the source so that you can get the flag.
