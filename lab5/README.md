Attention! This is not a standard CTF challenge. Your objective here is to create an EDSAC program that will showcase your initials on the long tank (the main memory tank). For example, if your name is Silaghi Fineas, your program should display the letters 'S' and 'F'. You can find a visual reference at this link: https://github.com/Fineas/EDSAC-playground/blob/master/img/memory.png

Once you've successfully written and tested your program on your local emulator, you need to share only the program's source on the classroom platform, under the private comments section . This is essential for the author to verify your solution. If your solution is correct, you'll receive the flag as a comment as well.

Attempting to submit a flag without first fulfilling the submission of your program on classroom, and receiving the flag from the administrators will result in penalties.
