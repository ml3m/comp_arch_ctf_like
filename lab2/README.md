(un)safe lock

I swear I did not stole this bike. I just forgot the input to open the lock. Can you break it for me?

Note: this is a static challenge. This means that there is no remote service. Your objective is to identify the correct input which makes the circuit return True. Then wrap the input between the flag format and submit it in the flag input box. Example: UVTCA{1001}
