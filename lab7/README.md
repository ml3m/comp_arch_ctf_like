Robotics Challenge: Virtual Traffic Light Simulation

Description:
Ever since October 2023, you've become a proud citizen of Timisoara. However, your newfound citizenship comes with an unexpected talent for turning into the Hulk due to prolonged exposure to the city's infuriating traffic lights. As a computer science student, you've decided it's time to channel your anger into something productive. So, let's take a virtual detour and create a traffic light simulation using the WOKWI platform. Your mission? Mimic the chaotic behavior of those real traffic lights – the relentless transitions between red, yellow, and green states. Time to bring order to the streets!

Platform for working:  https://wokwi.com/

The main board used will be the ESP32 and write the code in C embedded. Use whatever tutorials or documentation you wish.


Requirements:
1. LEDs as Traffic Lights: Use three LEDs to represent the red, yellow, and green lights of a traffic signal.

2. Push Button as Pedestrian Crosswalk: Include a push button in the simulation to simulate a pedestrian crosswalk. When pressed, it should trigger a red light on the traffic signal.

3. Timing Logic: Implement a timing logic to control the sequence of the traffic light changes. For example, the cycle could be: Green -> Yellow -> Red -> Red (pedestrian signal) -> Green.

4. Realistic Timing Intervals: Set realistic time intervals for each state (e.g., 10 seconds for green, 3 seconds for yellow, 10 seconds for red, 5 seconds for pedestrian red).

5. Think of something that the Traffic Lights in Timișoara are lacking or something that you would wish to have been implemented.


Bonus Challenges:
1. Randomized Pedestrian Crosswalk: Make the pedestrian crosswalk activation somewhat random, simulating a pedestrian pushing the button.

2. Visual Indicators: Display countdown timers for each state (e.g., show how many seconds are left for the green light).

3. Sound Effects: Add sound effects for each state change, such as a beep for pedestrian signal activation.


Grading:
Everyone, it's show-and-tell time! Each one of you is tasked with uploading a video on Classroom. Keep it snappy – your video should be no longer than 5 minutes. Hit that record button, capture your screen, and weave your magic by explaining the code while giving us a live demonstration.  Let the coding spectacle begin!
